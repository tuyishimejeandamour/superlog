// When a new error signature joins an incident, decide whether to start a fresh

// Background: a single root cause is a "fingerprint factory" — one bug surfaces
// as many distinct issues (per vendor, per log layer). Issue-grouping correctly
// folds them into one incident, but every new signature joining an incident
// re-armed the investigation trigger, so a still-firing incident was
// investigated again and again, opening a duplicate PR each time. Once an
// incident has already been investigated, a new signature should continue that
// investigation (it can confirm the existing fix already covers it, or extend
// it) instead of starting over.
